Homework 11
Continue developing your Volcano NFT project
1. Add a function that allows a user to mint an NFT if they pay 0.01 ETH, or an amount of
Volcano coin (decide on a price yourself).

. Make sure that when a token is minted we can specify a token URI - a location where
we can store metadata / images for the NFT.
-TokenURI is callable within ERC721. I added function to edit the _baseURI function in ERC721.

. What would be the problem with providing a function to allow us to change the token
URI ?
- If the token URI is changeable, any token could be manipulated to become any other token. 
The NFT would lose its non-fungible properties.

. Review the notes about the EVM in Lesson 5 in preparation for tomorrow's lesson
about gas optimisation.
