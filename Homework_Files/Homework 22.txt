Homework 22
Audit
Imagine you have been given the following code to audit
Contract
https://github.com/ExtropyIO/SolidityBootcamp/tree/main/audit

with the following note from the team
"DogCoinGame is a game where players are added to the contract via the addPlayer
function, they need to send 1 ETH to play.
Once 200 players have entered, the UI will be notified by the startPayout event, and will
pick 100 winners which will be added to the winners array, the UI will then call the payout
function to pay each of the winners.
The remaining balance will be kept as profit for the developers."
Write out the main points that you would include in an audit report.

- Lots of notes added, review BootcampHW22.sol for my notes to this contract.

- Main points: 
    - Improved access restrictions to functions
    - Better usage of integers for ether denominations
    - Reduction in storage variables for gas efficiency
    - Alternate logic recommendation in payout()
    - Alternate transfer method recommendation
    - Adding a receiveEther function to pay profits to developers
    - Removal of unused variables
