Homework 16

- I thought about using the autogenerating image AIs to take some base images and continually
generate new content automatically.
- While searching around figuring out how to input metadata correctly to the _baseURI, I found
an excellent resource. Can always count on the solidity docs :)
https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/metadata.html

. In the NFT Metadata - set some attributes/traits which can be viewed on OpenSea.

4. See if you can figure out how to store the NFT Metadata on chain within your NFT
Contract. Hint look into the Base64 library. Example
