- Teammates worked together on coming up with an idea to use an ERC721 contract
    to generate custom ERC721 implementation that we could each work on individually

    My implementation is an ETF ERC20. 
    Concept: Ownable ERC721 ETF contract that mints ERC20 shares equal to the 
        calculated NAV derived from TVL and token supply

    To do this, I used solmate ERC20 contract and chainlink priceFeeds.

    Once completing my implementation, I inherited Spoke implementation which are made
        thru the ERC721 SpokeHub. 

Reference Pricefeeds for mainnet fork testing and goerli deployment
    https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses#Ethereum%20Mainnet

    For mainnet addresses used, reference BootcampProjct.t.sol in test folder

    Goerli Testnet PriceFeeds
    0xD4a33860578De61DBAbDc8BFdb98FD742fA7028e //ETH/USD
    0x48731cF7e84dc94C5f84577882c14Be11a5B7456 //LINK/USD

    Goerli Tokens
    0x326C977E6efc84E512bB9C30f76E30c160eD06FB //LINK

Flow for Goerli deployment,
- Deployed SampleSpokeHub.sol after trimming some strings/functions due to error:
    Warning: Contract code size is 27717 bytes and exceeds 24576 bytes 
    (a limit introduced in Spurious Dragon)
    - Reference Shortened-Contracts directory, these are the contracts deployed on goerli
    address: 0x67df00D251b71a15776770ba5aFFb9EA6B5b3551

- Deployed CalculateNAV.sol 
    address: 0x7764ce9c6f7719A2feC604DC5C365af8aaa7b728

- Called the MintWithEth{value: 0.02 ether}(address CalculateNAV) function in 
    SampleSpokeHub which deploys ETFERC20 with 0.02 ether. and mints 1 ERC20 Token

- In ETFERC20, (0x1E0fcdc02dC33fb04Fa24E438E57a7024E2834b1)
    - called checkNAV() which returned: 0 
    [thats what we should see since theres no priceFeed yet]

    - called addETHPriceFeed(addresses above)
    - called addTrackedPriceFeeds(addresses above)

    - called checkNAV() which returned:
    24570011671200000000000000000000000000 = (0.02ether * eth price) / 1
    *noted* I should have minted 1x10^18 because decimals

    Does as intended! Wooooo! :D

No images or anything fancy, but the concept is there :)
