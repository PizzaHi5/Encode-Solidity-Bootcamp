Creating a fork of mainnet
See also lesson 9
See hardhat documentation 
https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/guides/forking-other-networks
You first need to have an account on Infura or Alchemy
https://www.alchemy.com/
This will give you a key so that you can use their RPC nodes.

Forking using ganache
npx ganache-cli --f https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<your key> -m
“your 12 word mnemonic” --unlock <address> -i <chain ID>

Fork from hardhat
In hardhat you can also specify this in the config file
npx hardhat node --fork https://ethmainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/<your key>
networks: {
 hardhat: {
 forking: {
 url: "https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/<key>",
 }
 }
}
