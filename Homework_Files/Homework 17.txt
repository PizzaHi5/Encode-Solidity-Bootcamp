Homework 17
. Create a fork of mainnet (details below)
. On the command line check the current block height, is this what you expected ?
. Can you transfer ETH from one of Vitalik's accounts to your own account ?

Creating a fork of mainnet
See also lesson 9
See hardhat documentation 
https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/guides/forking-other-networks
You first need to have an account on Infura or Alchemy
https://www.alchemy.com/
This will give you a key so that you can use their RPC nodes.

Forking using ganache
npx ganache-cli --f https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<your key> -m
“your 12 word mnemonic” --unlock <address> -i <chain ID>

Fork from hardhat
In hardhat you can also specify this in the config file
npx hardhat node --fork https://ethmainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/<your key>
networks: {
 hardhat: {
 forking: {
 url: "https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/<key>",
 }
 }
}

Lesson 20 documentation includes how to fork off mainnet using Foundry so I am opting for that
since Foundry is my preferred framework

- Using alchemy, performed:
    anvil --fork-url <your_rpc_url>    <--- Copy-pasta from alchemy
which started the local blockchain instance at Block Number 1592117, Genesis Timestamp 1668715563

- I then used:
cast rpc anvil_impersonateAccount 0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B
to become Vitalik's accounts

- Assigned myself and Vitalik using export
- Ran:
    cast balance $Vik
which returned 48644326225953525683 (this value is the same as what is shown on etherscan), 48eth

- Learned the difference between cast call and cast send after lots of playing around and reading Foundry documentation

- After lots of trying and reading how cast works, ran:
    cast send --value 48ether --from $Vik $Austin
This mined a transaction and sent me 48ether from Vitalik! :)

- Verified my account balance went up with:
    cast balance $Austin
    cast balance $Vik
