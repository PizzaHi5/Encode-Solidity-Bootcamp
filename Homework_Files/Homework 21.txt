Homework 21
Interacting with DeFi continued
. Continuing from homework 20, use your unit test as a basis to write a program to
interact with Uniswap.
2. Is it better to do one large trade or split it into two smaller trades in terms of the costs
involved ?

- Wrote a test script from the Unit tests in Hw20 that the test contract calls.

- I got Uniswap Factory off etherscan and tried to call its getPool function using IUniswapV3Factory.
    With the correct fee, dai, and busd addresses, this should return the pool address I need to get
    the current market price using IUniswapV3PoolState(pool).slot0() to make a swap. Everything
    compiles correctly however when I test, EVM fails. I suspect it has something to do with the ABIs
    for those addresses? I commented it out to try to make things simpler.
