Homework 9
Volcano NFT
We now want to create an NFT.
We will use the Open Zeppelin libraries to help with this.
1. Create a new project in the IDE of you choice called NFTProject
2. Create a VolcanoNFT contract this should inherit from ERC721 from the Open
Zeppelin standard libraries
. Give your NFT a name and a symbol.
. Write unit tests to check that you can
1. Mint new NFTs
2. Transfer an NFT
. Deploy your contract to Goerli and send some NFTs to your colleagues.
