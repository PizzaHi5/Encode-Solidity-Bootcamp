Homework 9
Volcano NFT
We now want to create an NFT.
We will use the Open Zeppelin libraries to help with this.
1. Create a new project in the IDE of you choice called NFTProject
2. Create a VolcanoNFT contract this should inherit from ERC721 from the Open
Zeppelin standard libraries
. Give your NFT a name and a symbol.
. Write unit tests to check that you can
1. Mint new NFTs
On Goerli, deployed VolcanoNFT ERC721:
0xEd5754601b3de7c5B2e99dd1abdc739E94F47434

Minted new NFT in this txn to myself:
0xdbbdde8251026544e54fa00becbb68d6d175a491f304f1354279ce10c9ed8e42

2. Transfer an NFT
This is the txn to a colleague for the NFT using SafeTransferFrom:
0xe157387861f198ed4301fb848aab026372139899d8c992f5d3eb90a3127456f1

. Deploy your contract to Goerli and send some NFTs to your colleagues.
