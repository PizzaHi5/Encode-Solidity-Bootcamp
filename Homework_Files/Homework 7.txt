Homework 7
Adding more functionality to the Volcano Coin contract
. We made a payment mapping, but we haven始t added all the functionality for it yet.
Write a function to view the payment records, specifying the user as an input.
What is the difference between doing this and making the mapping public ?
- By doing this, users can only call the function. They cannot directly interact with the mapping. 
This is good to prevent the overflow exploit where ppL would purposely overload a mapping to
make interacting with that mapping cost a ton of gas to iterate thru.
We can also add restrictions to this function too, example onlyOwner.

. For the payments record mapping, create a function called recordPayment that
takes
. the sender始s address,
. the receiver始s address and
. the amount
as an input, then creates a new payment record and adds the new record to the
user始s payment record.
. Each time we make a transfer of tokens, we should call the this recordPayment
function to record the transfer.
